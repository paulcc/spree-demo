== Description

State machines make it dead-simple to manage the behavior of a model.  Too often,
the status of a record is kept by creating multiple boolean columns in the table
and deciding how to behave based on the values in those columns.  This can become
cumbersome and difficult to maintain when the complexity of your models starts to
increase.

+state_machine+ simplifies this design by introducing the various parts of a real
state machine, including states, events, and transitions.  However, the api is
designed to be similar to ActiveRecord in terms of validations and callbacks,
making it so simple you don't even need to know what a state machine is :)

== Usage

=== Example

Below is an example of many of the features offered by this plugin, including
* Initial states
* Transition callbacks
* Conditional transitions

  class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    state_machine :state, :initial => 'idling' do
      before_transition :from => %w(parked idling), :do => :put_on_seatbelt
      after_transition :to => 'parked', :do => lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.update_attribute(:seatbelt_on, false)}
      after_transition :on => 'crash', :do => :tow!
      after_transition :on => 'repair', :do => :fix!
      
      event :park do
        transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(idling first_gear)
      end
      
      event :ignite do
        transition :to => 'stalled', :from => 'stalled'
        transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
      end
      
      event :idle do
        transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'first_gear'
      end
      
      event :shift_up do
        transition :to => 'first_gear', :from => 'idling'
        transition :to => 'second_gear', :from => 'first_gear'
        transition :to => 'third_gear', :from => 'second_gear'
      end
      
      event :shift_down do
        transition :to => 'second_gear', :from => 'third_gear'
        transition :to => 'first_gear', :from => 'second_gear'
      end
      
      event :crash do
        transition :to => 'stalled', :from => %w(first_gear second_gear third_gear), :unless => :auto_shop_busy?
      end
      
      event :repair do
        transition :to => 'parked', :from => 'stalled', :if => :auto_shop_busy?
      end
    end
    
    def tow!
      # do something here
    end
    
    def fix!
      # do something here
    end
    
    def auto_shop_busy?
      false
    end
  end

Using the above model as an example, you can interact with the state machine
like so:

  vehicle = Vehicle.create  # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: false, state: "parked">
  vehicle.ignite            # => true
  vehicle                   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: true, state: "idling">
  vehicle.shift_up          # => true
  vehicle                   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: true, state: "first_gear">
  vehicle.shift_up          # => true
  vehicle                   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: true, state: "second_gear">
  
  # The bang (!) operator can raise exceptions if the event fails
  vehicle.park!             # => PluginAWeek::StateMachine::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition via :park from "second_gear"

=== With enumerations

Using the acts_as_enumeration[http://github.com/pluginaweek/acts_as_enumeration] plugin
states can be transparently stored using record ids in the database like so:

  class VehicleState < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_enumeration
    
    create :id => 1, :name => 'parked'
    create :id => 2, :name => 'idling'
    create :id => 3, :name => 'first_gear'
    ...
  end
  
  class Vehicle < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :state, :class_name => 'VehicleState'
    
    state_machine :state, :initial => 'idling' do
      ...
      
      event :park do
        transition :to => 'parked', :from => %w(idling first_gear)
      end
      
      event :ignite do
        transition :to => 'stalled', :from => 'stalled'
        transition :to => 'idling', :from => 'parked'
      end
    end
    
    ...
  end

Notice in the above example, the state machine definition remains *exactly* the
same.  However, when interacting with the records, the actual state will be
stored using the identifiers defined for the enumeration:

  vehicle = Vehicle.create  # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: false, state_id: 1>
  vehicle.ignite            # => true
  vehicle                   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: true, state_id: 2>
  vehicle.shift_up          # => true
  vehicle                   # => #<Vehicle id: 1, seatbelt_on: true, state_id: 3>

This allows states to take on more complex functionality other than just being
a string value.

== Tools

Jean Bovet - {Visual Automata Simulator}[http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~jbovet/vas.html].
This is a great tool for "simulating, visualizing and transforming finite state
automata and Turing Machines".  This tool can help in the creation of states and
events for your models.  It is cross-platform, written in Java.

== Testing

Before you can run any tests, the following gem must be installed:
* plugin_test_helper[http://github.com/pluginaweek/plugin_test_helper]

To run against a specific version of Rails:

  rake test RAILS_FRAMEWORK_ROOT=/path/to/rails

== Dependencies

* Rails 2.1 or later
